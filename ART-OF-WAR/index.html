                  <h3>WHO IS GENERAL SUN TZU?</h3>
                  <h2>The GREATEST MILITARY STRAGIST</h2>
                  <p>The oldest available sources disagree as to where Sun Tzu was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states–Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, and Yan–who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China.

                  <h2>THE ART OF WAR</h2>
                  <p>This Collectable Hardbound Deluxe Edition is beautifully crafted and designed. Perfect for gifting as well as for keeps. A prized edition for any library. The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. The Art of War is an enduring classic that holds a special place in the culture and history of East Asia. An ancient Chinese text on the philosophy and politics of warfare and military strategy, the treatise was written in 6th century B.C. by a warrior-philosopher now famous all over the world as Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu s teachings remain as relevant to leaders and strategists today as they were to rulers and military generals in ancient times. Divided into thirteen chapters and written succinctly, The Art of War is a must read for anybody who works in an competitive environment or who is interested in warfare, strategy and Chinese history.
